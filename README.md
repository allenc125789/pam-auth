# PAM Wrapper Packages:

## NGINX/APACHE
- apache2-utils (Tutorial by Susan B: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6GtcQA15Y)

Web-server wrapper for authentication. Can't pass arguments or strings for back-end processing.

## C Language
- libpam-dev (Tutorial by fedetask: https://github.com/fedetask/pam-tutorials)

This process involves creating and compiling a script in C directly interacting with the PAM system. Not really a wrapper as it is a direct method for interaction.
