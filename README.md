### PAM Wrapper Packages:

## NGINX/APACHE
- apache2-utils (Tutorial by Susan B: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6GtcQA15Y)



## C Language
- libpam-dev (Tutorial by fedetask: https://github.com/fedetask/pam-tutorials)

This process involves creating and compiling a script in C directly interacting with the PAM system.

Message me if you find more solutions. I would love to reference them here as I'm finding myself constantly in need for different methods for different solutions.
