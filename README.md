# PAM Wrapper Packages:

## Nginx/Apache
- apache2-utils (Tutorial by Susan B: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6GtcQA15Y)

Web-server wrapper for authentication using the auth_basic module.

## Python3

### (Debian)

python3-pam (Script and information in the repo's code. Lost original source for the script.)


## C Language
- libpam-dev (Tutorial by fedetask: https://github.com/fedetask/pam-tutorials)

(More Resources) https://web.archive.org/web/20220516124114/http://www.linux-pam.org/Linux-PAM-html/Linux-PAM_MWG.html

This process involves creating and compiling a script in C directly interacting with the PAM system. Not really a wrapper as it is a direct method for interaction.
